K & R Questions

Here will contain the implementation of some examples taken from the book 
"The C programming language" by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan.

Note that not necessarily the examples will be implemented in the same way
as the book, nor will it be a 'rewrite' of them, will only serve as a guide
form for new programmers in C.
